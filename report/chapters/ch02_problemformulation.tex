    \chapter{Problem Statement}
    Many robots today are heavy, energy-consuming, and costly to manufacture. During motion planning, contact surfaces are often treated as obstacles, resulting in the robotâ€™s joints remaining in mid-air. This approach can lead to wasted energy as the robot must expend energy to maintain its joints and links in such a pose. Additionally, existing dynamic solvers do not handle partial constraint conditions. In this R\&D project, we will explore an approach that addresses the dynamics of this situation. By considering contact surfaces as opportunities rather than obstacles, we aim to develop a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for robotic motion planning.
