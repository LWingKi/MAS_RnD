    \chapter{Background}
    In section \ref{Limitations of previous work}, the limitations of the current research has been raised. In order to control the robot to move along a contact surface without sensory input, there were researchers, Vereshchagin and Popov ,proposed a hybrid dynamic algorithms and tried to tackle the problem of exploting the defined contraints,robot model, joint angles, joint velocities, feed forward torque and external forces to compute the required joint torque and joint accelerations as command that being sent to the robots\cite{vereshchagin1989modeling}.
