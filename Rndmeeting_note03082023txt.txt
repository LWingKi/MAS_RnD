Rnd + thesis meeting note 03082023

doubt:
1. robot motion -> tiltle down (gravity?) , drop faster with gripper even added the weight
2. robot motion (move forward) -> tilt up 


thesis idea:

1. explotinig more contact to different surfaces (walls / slope .etc)
2. with sensing info (addiotnal IMU / camera)
3. building/constructing the world environment via contact (moving along a surface to "detect" corner/edges then build the environment)
4. correcting the existing model  (Robot think about the model (prior knowledge) different from the actual contact)
5. what is the ROI base on contact  (many data receive but pick the important one eg: edge/corner to build the model)
6. object as probe to explore the environment
7. moderliy -> different texture -> imply to different object
8. control the other part of the link -> activate the task via contact (touch a surface then do other tasks)
9. add IMU and RGB camera -> no need for RGB-D

application POV:
robot resting tesk -> other joint contact detection
fine control  


define / asumpition
environment is known or unknown (seeking task/motion oppotunity)


active perception

(no IMU in ee?)
additional modarity as prior
